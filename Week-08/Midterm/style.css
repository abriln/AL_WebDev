    I really cant describe it on a comment, i would have to draw it. remind me. 
    (i prob wont forget and will have a drawing ready to show you tuesday so remind me to show you
    note for myself when i explain it to you so u can explain it . padding is applied inward, not outward. technically
    actually you probably shouldnt mention this. but if the professor asks and i didnt tell 
    you before hand, youre screwed. so yea
