# Homework for Week-11

For this week's homework, I decided to add on to my midterm. I created a "Back to Top" button that appears when the user scrolls down. This will be helpful for users when scrolling through the product page of my website. 

As of right now there's just a bunch of multiples of the same 6 products, for the final I will create more branded products.
